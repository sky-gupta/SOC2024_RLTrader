DQN.ipynb is the notebook for mid term submission. It is a neural network that gives Q value based on Deep Q learning on atari game. I have choosed Cartpole game for training and evaluating the network.
Best way is to veiw the notebook in vs code or google colab as in github, full output is there for training process which makes it unportable to view.
